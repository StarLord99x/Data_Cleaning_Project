## Project Summary

This is the capstone project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course
from Johns Hopkins University. The purpose of this project is to
demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The data set contains data collected from the accelerometers of a
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the data is
available at:
